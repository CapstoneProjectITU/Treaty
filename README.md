# Treaty

In today’s competitive world where the customer is spoilt for choice, it’s difficult for a business to retain customers. The businesses usually rely on loyalty programs to attract and retain customers. The customer is issued a loyalty membership card, which he has to carry every time an offer is to be availed at a store. To manage multiple membership cards is a hassle for a customer. So, we are trying to address these problems by developing a Web application – Treaty.

Treaty is a loyalty rewards management system that will offer unique and exceptional rewards to places you love to shop or dine. It will be a platform where the business owners and the customers can collaborate and get benefit from each other. Treaty will allow the business owners to post their offers and on the other hand the customers to track the offers and their loyalty points they have earned.
